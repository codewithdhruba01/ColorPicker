## Key Features Explained

### Image Color Extraction
The app uses HTML5 Canvas API to analyze uploaded images and extract dominant colors using a k-means clustering algorithm. Users can:
- Upload any image format
- Extract up to 8 dominant colors
- Click specific pixels to pick exact colors

### Color Conversion
Comprehensive color format conversion including:
- HEX ↔ RGB ↔ HSL ↔ HSV ↔ CMYK
- Accurate conversion algorithms
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Accessibility Testing
Built-in WCAG compliance checker:
- Calculates contrast ratios
- Tests against AA (4.5:1) and AAA (7:1) standards
- Shows text on background previews
- Provides pass/fail recommendations

### Color Theory Tools
Generate harmonious color schemes based on color theory:
- Complementary (180° apart)
- Analogous (30° apart)
- Triadic (120° apart)
- Tetradic (90° apart)

### Color Blindness Simulation
Uses scientifically-accurate matrices to simulate:
- Protanopia (1% of males)
- Deuteranopia (6% of males)
- Tritanopia (rare)
